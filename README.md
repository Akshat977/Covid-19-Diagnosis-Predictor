# major-project
ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this project is fast and efficient screening of COVID-19 patients based on symptoms to reduce the burden of Hospitals. The research is in the domain of Machine Learning. The techniques used will be ensemble learning which includes using various models for the same prediction to increase effectives. The models will be made to fit the train dataset in an effective manner using Hyperparameter optimization. Cross validation will be used to increase accuracy of the model. The research is ongoing and preliminary results include high positive correlation between symptoms such as unseasonal cough, contact with a diagnosed patient, etc. The data analysis reveals a positive correlation between patients' gender and deaths, and also indicates that the majority of patients are aged between 30 and 70 years. This project is significant in these times when the healthcare centers and hospitals are being flooded with new and positive cases. So, we need a screening system which would place a certain number of patients in priority which reduces the burden.
