# Covid-19 Diagnosis Predictor

The project is a an ensembled Random Forest-Adaboost model which has been deployed on Heroku as a webapp.
The model predicts your diagnosis based on the input symptoms.
The model is based on the December 2020 variant of Covid-19 and its corresponding symptoms.

This model can be used by hospitals and institutions which are overflooded with Covid-19 patients for effective screening.
